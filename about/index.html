                <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Born and raised in Germany near Munich, I graduated high school in 2016. Successful in track and field (decathlon), I took on a scholarship opportunity to study in the United States. Completing my freshman year in Milwaukee, I transferred to the University of Arkansas at Little Rock in 2017. I graduated with a Bachelor in Business and Economics and Finance in May 2020 and I am on track to finish my Bachelor in Business Analytics in May 2021.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="strengths">Strengths</h2>
<ul>
<li>Critical Thinking</li>
<li>Problem Solving</li>
<li>Teamwork</li>
<li>Taking Responsibility</li>
<li>Goal Oriented</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="athletics">Athletics</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Track and Field  and the decathlon taught me valuable lessons for life, such as perseverance, discipline, and how to follow habits that set me up for success. I have always been an active child and loved sports and the outdoors. I still enjoy going hiking, skiing, and biking as much as possible. For more information on my athletic career and what sports taught me, check out my <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/moh98">LinkedIn profile</a>. To see me in action, stop by my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYzJda-h5Hq1jN4sxFtwWog">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="other-interests">Other Interests</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides sports, I am passionate about learning and continuous learning. A career in which one stops learning after graduating university is a relict of the past. Besides data science and programming, I am very curious about geography (I love maps and charts), history (of today and tomorrow), and economics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of my favorite books are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Rational Optimist -  Matt Ridley</li>
<li>Enlightenment Now - Steven Pinker</li>
<li>Meditations - Marcus Aurelius</li>
<li>Weapons of Math Destructions - Cathy O&rsquo;Neil</li>
<li>Atomic Habits - James Clear</li>
</ul>
